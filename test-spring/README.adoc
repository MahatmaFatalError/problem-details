= Problem Details Spring Boot Test Suite

This is the test suite for Spring Boot, i.e. a Spring Boot app exposing various problem detail errors and a set of integration tests using the client side api to check it.

Note that the tests can check various Testcontainers or an already running service, which can also be the JAX-RS test app.
