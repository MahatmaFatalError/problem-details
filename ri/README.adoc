= Problem Details Dummy Implementation for JAX-RS

This is a JAX-RS dummy implementation for the Problem Details API. It's just a dummy, because:

a. it's not built into the container, you'll have to package it into your applications, which means they are not a thin war any more.

b. it doesn't handle `@Valid` annotated parameters and other exceptions that the container produces.

c. the exceptions on the client side are wrapped in a ResponseProcessingException.

It implements an `ExceptionMapper` for the server side and a `ClientResponseFilter` for the client.
