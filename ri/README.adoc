= Problem Details Dummy Implementation for JAX-RS

This is a JAX-RS dummy implementation for the Problem Details API. It's just a dummy, because

a. it's not built into the container, you'll have to build it into your applications

b. it doesn't handle `@Valid` annotated parameters and other exceptions that the container produces.
